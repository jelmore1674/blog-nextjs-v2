Slipstream Racing was one of my first projects as a developer. Actually, it was the project that got me into development! Because of Slipstream Racing, I am now a full time developer for a month.

## Humble Beginnings

The story of my developer journey begins with Slipstream Racing. I'm a huge motorsports fan. I love any kind of racing, Formula 1, IndyCar, NASCAR, IMSA, etc. So I started sim-racing. Which is one of my favorite hobbies. Well, when the pandemic stared out, sim-racing was at an all time boom. My sim of choice at the time was Assetto Corsa Competizione. Which is a GT3 simulator. I founded a sim-racing league called "Slipstream Racing".

### Google Sites

After our first season I was thinking of ways to increase the number of drivers we have. First idea was to create a website. Well, I never done any development at that point and jumped on Google Sites. For those who don't know, Google Sites is a drag and drop website builder. It's free and very limited on what you can and can't do. I spent so much time and effort to create the site, but in doing so it made me want to keep working to build to a better website. So, I decided to learn a few basics on FreeCodeCamp. After that, I decided it was time to change platforms.

## Deciding on what to do next

While learning some of the basics of web development, I still didn't know a whole lot at this point and didn't know any backend or javascript at this time. So I was at a crossroads on what to do next. Build a site full with HTML and CSS, or build a site with a backend and CMS. I decided to go with the latter. Wordpress. And I jumped in head first building a site out with Wordpress. I even got Elementor and spent a couple months working on the website. That's when I made the choice to go all in with web development. I started learning Node.js and Express.js. I also started learning React.js. I also started learning Docker, and fell in love with it.

### Why move away from Wordpress?

After nearly two years of the site being on Wordpress, I want to transition away from it. I know more than I did at the time and am ready to use the skills I have learned and continue to grow from my professional experience. I want to create a site that is easier to maintain. Seriously, Wordpress plugin updates are a pain. Keeping it updated is a pain. I want to build something that is simple and easy to maintain, but now I can add features and functionality that wasn't there before.

## Planning My Project

Now that I've decided to build from scratch. It's time to plan out the project. So, what's the end goal. Clean, simple, and easy to maintain.

### Front-end

For the front end, I need something that loads fast, quick to build, and easy to build upon. Going through my options, and my experience with React. Something like NextJS or Gatsby would be great choices. Most of the site would work great being static. I really love NextJS, I think it would fit perfect for what I desire from the site.

### Back-end

As far as handling things on the backend, I don't think building a API from scratch is needed. For, what the site is and needs, a simple CMS, would be great. The site is already on Wordpress. So, I could just turn that into a headless CMS. I could also use something like Strapi, and migrate some of the content over. Which will take a little more time. But, I think it would be worth it. I could use something like Contnetful, or any other CMS as a service, but I like hosting and setting it up on my own.

## Next Steps

Throught my steps of building the new Slipstream Racing site, I am going to change my blog at least once a week. Sharing the progress of the site and share some of the knowledge I have gained. I think this will be a great learning experience for us. So, this is what is on the plan for this week. I will work on the design and build the home landing page. The goal isn't to build i
